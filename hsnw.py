#good values for M lie between 5 and 48, High M is better for high dimensionality and recall -> dim = 70 therefore M must be High
#Higher values of efConstruction imply a more profound search as more candidates are explored. However, it requires more computations. Authors recommend choosing such an efConstruction value that results at recall being close to 0.95â€“1 during training.
#M_MAX must be close to 2*M
#heuristic of selecting M out of efConstruction is both closest Nodes and connectivity of th graph by considering the connectivity distances between the candidates
